{"question":"If the Weber's test demonstrates that sound is louder in the affected ear in a patient with unilateral conductive hearing loss, what may be the cause of their hearing loss?","exp":"If Weber's test demonstrates that sound is louder in the affected ear in a patient with unilateral conductive hearing loss, the cause may be otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is a condition where abnormal bone growth fixes the stapes bone in the middle ear, preventing it from vibrating and causing conductive hearing loss. In Weber's test, sound lateralizes to the ear with conductive hearing loss because bone conduction is enhanced relative to air conduction in that ear. Otosclerosis is a common cause of conductive hearing loss, particularly in young to middle-aged adults. It typically begins in the second or third decade of life and is more common in women than in men. The condition often affects both ears but may be asymmetric. Other causes of conductive hearing loss include otitis media, tympanic membrane perforation, and cerumen impaction, but otosclerosis is a classic example that would produce the Weber's test finding described. In contrast, presbycusis, noise-induced hearing loss, and Meniere's disease typically cause sensorineural hearing loss, which would result in sound lateralizing to the unaffected ear in Weber's test.","cop":1,"opa":"Otosclerosis","opb":"Presbycusis","opc":"Noise-induced hearing loss","opd":"Meniere's disease","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_weber_otosclerosis_081","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which of the following conditions is associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a viral infection that can cause facial nerve palsy?","exp":"Ramsay Hunt syndrome, also known as herpes zoster oticus, is associated with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. This condition occurs when the varicella-zoster virus reactivates in the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve, causing facial nerve palsy along with a characteristic painful vesicular rash in the ear canal or on the auricle. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a more severe cause of facial nerve palsy than Bell's palsy. In addition to facial weakness, patients typically experience severe ear pain, a vesicular rash in the distribution of the facial nerve, and may also have hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and loss of taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The condition is treated with antiviral medications (like acyclovir) and corticosteroids.

{"question":"Which tests are used to assess light touch sensation in the upper limb examination?","exp":"Two-point discrimination and monofilament testing are used to assess light touch sensation in the upper limb examination. Two-point discrimination evaluates the ability to distinguish two separate points applied simultaneously to the skin, while monofilament testing (using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) assesses the threshold for detecting light touch pressure. Light touch sensation is mediated by large myelinated A-beta fibers that carry information from mechanoreceptors in the skin. Two-point discrimination is particularly important for assessing the function of the fingertips and is often tested in the hand. Monofilament testing is more quantitative and can detect subtle sensory deficits, making it valuable for conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral neuropathy. Other tests listed assess different sensory modalities: pinprick and temperature assess small fiber function (pain and temperature), vibratory and position sense assess large fiber proprioception, while Romberg and past-pointing tests assess coordination and balance rather than sensation specifically.","cop":2,"opa":"Pinprick and temperature testing","opb":"Two-point discrimination and monofilament testing","opc":"Vibratory sense and position sense testing","opd":"Romberg test and past-pointing test","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_light_touch_tests_083","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is the cause of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)?","exp":"Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), a fiber tract that connects the abducens nucleus (CN VI) in the pons with the oculomotor nucleus (CN III) in the midbrain. This pathway is essential for coordinating horizontal gaze movements, particularly adduction of the eye during lateral gaze. In INO, when the patient attempts to look to one side, the eye on the same side as the lesion (ipsilateral eye) has impaired adduction, while the contralateral eye abducts normally but may exhibit nystagmus. This occurs because the MLF lesion disrupts the signal from the abducens nucleus on one side to the oculomotor nucleus on the opposite side, preventing coordinated horizontal gaze. INO is most commonly caused by multiple sclerosis (in younger patients) or stroke (in older patients), but can also result from other conditions like trauma, tumor, or infection.","cop":3,"opa":"Lesion of the oculomotor nerve","opb":"Lesion of the trochlear nerve","opc":"Lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)","opd":"Lesion of the abducens nerve","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_internuclear_ophthalmoplegia_084","choice_type":"single"}

While it can cause various neurological symptoms, it does not typically cause a peripheral polyneuropathy, which affects peripheral nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. The other options listed are common causes of peripheral polyneuropathy. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, particularly a distal symmetric sensorimotor neuropathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a peripheral neuropathy, often with a combination of sensory and motor symptoms.

{"question":"What is the primary function of light touch sensation in the upper limb?","exp":"The primary function of light touch sensation in the upper limb is to provide feedback about object texture and shape. Light touch sensation is mediated by mechanoreceptors in the skin that respond to light pressure and vibration, allowing us to perceive the physical characteristics of objects we touch, such as their texture, shape, size, and surface properties. Light touch sensation is essential for fine motor tasks and object manipulation in the upper limb. It allows us to identify objects by touch alone (stereognosis) and to adjust our grip based on the texture and weight of objects. This sensory modality is distinct from pain and temperature sensation (mediated by different nerve fibers), which primarily serve protective functions. While light touch sensation indirectly contributes to balance and posture through its role in proprioception, its primary function in the upper limb is related to object recognition and manipulation, not balance maintenance or muscle strength control.","cop":2,"opa":"To detect pain and temperature","opb":"To provide feedback about object texture and shape","opc":"To maintain balance and posture","opd":"To control muscle strength","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_light_touch_function_086","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is the purpose of Phalen's Test?","exp":"The purpose of Phalen's Test is to assess median nerve function, specifically to help diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The test involves holding the wrist in maximum flexion for 60 seconds, which increases pressure in the carpal tunnel and may reproduce the patient's symptoms if the median nerve is compressed. Phalen's Test is one of the most commonly used clinical tests for carpal tunnel syndrome. When the wrist is flexed, the pressure within the carpal tunnel increases, potentially compressing the median nerve. If the median nerve is already compromised, this increased pressure will reproduce the patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, or pain in the distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger). While not highly sensitive, Phalen's Test is relatively specific for carpal tunnel syndrome and is often used in conjunction with Tinel's sign and other clinical assessments.","cop":1,"opa":"To assess median nerve function","opb":"To evaluate ulnar nerve function","opc":"To test radial nerve function","opd":"To examine axillary nerve function","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_phalens_purpose_087","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"A 25-year-old male presents with foot drop and difficulty dorsiflexing the ankle. On examination, there is weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion, and decreased sensation over the dorsum of the foot. What is the most likely cause of these findings?","exp":"The most likely cause of these findings is a common peroneal (fibular) nerve injury. The common peroneal nerve innervates the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior) and eversion (peroneus longus and brevis) of the foot. It also provides sensory innervation to the dorsum of the foot (except for the web space between the first and second toes, which is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve). Injury to this nerve typically causes weakness in dorsiflexion and eversion, resulting in foot drop, along with sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. The common peroneal nerve is particularly vulnerable to injury as it wraps around the fibular head just below the knee. Compression at this site can occur due to prolonged crossing of legs, kneeling, or during surgery. While L5 nerve root compression can also cause weakness in dorsiflexion, it typically affects other muscles innervated by L5 (like the gluteus medius) and may cause sensory loss in a different distribution (lateral leg and dorsum of foot). Sciatic nerve injury would affect both peroneal and tibial nerve functions, causing both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion weakness. Tibial nerve injury would primarily affect plantar flexion and inversion, not dorsiflexion and eversion.","cop":1,"opa":"Common peroneal (fibular) nerve injury","opb":"Sciatic nerve injury","opc":"L5 nerve root compression","opd":"Tibial nerve injury","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_foot_drop_case_088","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is the underlying cause of apraxic gait?","exp":"The underlying cause of apraxic gait is disruption of frontal lobe motor planning circuits. Apraxic gait is a disorder of motor planning rather than execution, where patients have difficulty with the initiation and organization of the motor sequences required for walking, despite having normal strength, coordination, and sensation. Apraxic of gait is often seen in conditions affecting the frontal lobes, particularly normal pressure hydrocephalus, bilateral frontal lobe lesions, or diffuse cerebral disorders like Alzheimer's disease. The frontal lobes, especially the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex, are responsible for planning and initiating complex motor sequences like walking. When these areas are damaged, patients may have difficulty with gait initiation,表现为 feet that seem 'stuck to the floor' (magnetic gait), and a wide-based, unsteady gait with short steps.

{"question":"Which of the following questions can be used to assess orientation to time?","exp":"'What is today's date?' is a question that can be used to assess orientation to time. Orientation to time involves awareness of the current date, day of the week, month, season, and year. This is one component of the mental status examination that assesses a person's awareness of their immediate circumstances and is often affected in conditions like delirium, dementia, or other cognitive impairments. Orientation is typically assessed in three domains: time, place, and person. 'What is your name?' assesses orientation to person, 'Where are you right now?' assesses orientation to place, and 'What is today's date?' assesses orientation to time. 'Who is the current president?' assesses general knowledge rather than orientation specifically. Disorientation to time is often the first to occur in cognitive decline, followed by disorientation to place, and finally to person.

While other devices can provide oxygen, they deliver lower concentrations and would not be as effective in rapidly correcting the hypoxemia.","cop":3,"opa":"Simple face mask at 5 L/min","opb":"Nasal cannula at 2 L/min","opc":"Non-rebreather mask at 10 L/min","opd":"Venturi mask at 24%","subject_name":"Respiratory","topic_name":null,"id":"respiratory_hypoxemia_oxygen_delivery_090","choice_type":"single"}
