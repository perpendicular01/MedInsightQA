This nerve is particularly vulnerable as it wraps around the fibular head just below the knee, making it susceptible to compression injuries. Foot drop, characterized by difficulty lifting the foot and toes, is most commonly caused by common peroneal nerve injury. This nerve can be compressed at the fibular head (from prolonged crossing of legs, kneeling, or during surgery), leading to weakness in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg, which control ankle dorsiflexion and eversion.","cop":3,"opa":"Sciatic nerve","opb":"Tibial nerve","opc":"Common peroneal (fibular) nerve","opd":"Femoral nerve","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_foot_drop_nerve_011","choice_type":"single"}

{"question":"Which statement about peripheral polyneuropathy is correct?","exp":"Peripheral polyneuropathy typically presents with a \"stocking-glove\" pattern of sensory loss, meaning symptoms begin in the feet and hands and progress upward. This pattern occurs because the longest nerve fibers are most vulnerable to damage. Patients often experience numbness, tingling, burning pain, or loss of sensation in a symmetrical distribution affecting the distal extremities first. Peripheral polyneuropathy affects the peripheral nervous system, not the central nervous system. It has many causes including diabetes mellitus (which is common but not the only cause), alcohol abuse, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, infections, medications, and hereditary factors. Depending on the type and severity, it can cause not only sensory symptoms but also weakness, muscle atrophy, and reduced reflexes.","cop":2,"opa":"It primarily affects the central nervous system","opb":"It typically presents with a \"stocking-glove\" pattern of sensory loss","opc":"It is always caused by diabetes mellitus","opd":"It rarely causes weakness","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_polyneuropathy_fact_035","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is the normal response to the pharyngeal reflex?","exp":"The normal response to the pharyngeal reflex (gag reflex) is elevation of the soft palate and contraction of the pharyngeal muscles, resulting in gagging. This reflex is tested by touching the posterior pharynx with a tongue depressor, which stimulates sensory fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and leads to motor response via the vagus nerve (CN X). The pharyngeal reflex is a protective mechanism that helps prevent foreign objects from entering the pharynx. It involves both sensory (afferent) components via the glossopharyngeal nerve and motor (efferent) components via the vagus nerve. An absent or diminished gag reflex can indicate brainstem injury, nerve damage, or can be seen in conditions like bulbar palsy. It's important to note that some healthy individuals may have a naturally diminished gag reflex.","cop":2,"opa":"Constriction of the pupils","opb":"Elevation of the soft palate and gagging","opc":"Contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle","opd":"Protrusion of the tongue","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_pharyngeal_reflex_036","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What diagnosis involves inflammation of the optic nerve due to demyelination?","exp":"Optic neuritis is the diagnosis that involves inflammation of the optic nerve due to demyelination. It is characterized by acute or subacute vision loss, eye pain (especially with movement), reduced color vision, and visual field defects. It is often associated with multiple sclerosis but can occur independently. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory condition that damages the myelin covering of the optic nerve fibers. It is a common presenting symptom of multiple sclerosis, with about 50% of MS patients experiencing optic neuritis at some point. The condition typically affects young adults (20-40 years) and women more than men.

{"question":"Which cranial nerves are involved in the Corneal Reflex?","exp":"The corneal reflex involves both the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and the facial nerve (CN VII). The afferent (sensory) limb of the reflex is mediated by the trigeminal nerve, specifically the ophthalmic branch (V1), which carries sensation from the cornea. The efferent (motor) limb is mediated by the facial nerve, which innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle responsible for eyelid closure. When the cornea is touched, the sensory stimulus travels via the trigeminal nerve to the brainstem, where it synapses and activates the facial nerve nucleus, resulting in bilateral blinking. This reflex is protective, helping to prevent damage to the eye. An absent or diminished corneal reflex can indicate damage to either the trigeminal or facial nerve, or brainstem pathology. It's important to note that the reflex response is typically bilateral, meaning both eyes blink even when only one cornea is stimulated.","cop":2,"opa":"Cranial nerves II and III","opb":"Cranial nerves V and VII","opc":"Cranial nerves IX and X","opd":"Cranial nerves VI and VII","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_corneal_reflex_039","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which cranial nerve is directly involved in Rinne's test?","exp":"The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) is directly involved in Rinne's test as it carries auditory information from the cochlea to the brain. Rinne's test compares air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) of sound to evaluate hearing ability and differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. During Rinne's test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed first on the mastoid process (bone conduction) and then near the ear canal (air conduction). The vestibulocochlear nerve transmits the auditory signals generated by these vibrations to the brain for interpretation. If there is damage to this nerve or the inner ear it innervates, it can result in sensorineural hearing loss, which would be detected during Rinne's test as reduced air conduction but preserved bone conduction (AC > BC, but both are reduced compared to normal).","cop":3,"opa":"Cranial Nerve II (Optic)","opb":"Cranial Nerve VII (Facial)","opc":"Cranial Nerve VIII (Vestibulocochlear)","opd":"Cranial Nerve X (Vagus)","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_rinne_nerve_040","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"The Tinel's sign test can help identify which of the following conditions?","exp":"Tinel's sign is a clinical test used to identify nerve compression or irritation, particularly carpal tunnel syndrome. During the test, the examiner taps over the carpal tunnel at the wrist. A positive Tinel's sign is indicated by tingling or paresthesia in the distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger), suggesting median nerve compression at the wrist. Tinel's sign is based on the principle that tapping an injured or compressed nerve will generate tingling sensations in its distribution. While it is most commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, it can also be used to identify other nerve compression syndromes like cubital tunnel syndrome (ulnar nerve at the elbow) or tarsal tunnel syndrome (tibial nerve at the ankle). However, it's important to note that Tinel's sign has variable sensitivity and specificity, so it's usually used in conjunction with other clinical tests and diagnostic studies.","cop":1,"opa":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","opb":"Rotator cuff tear","opc":"Achilles tendon rupture","opd":"Herniated disc","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_tinel_sign_041","choice_type":"single"}

This test evaluates the patient's ability to perform rapid, repetitive, alternating movements, such as pronating and supinating the hand on the thigh or tapping fingers rapidly. It helps detect cerebellar dysfunction, which often presents as clumsiness or irregularity in performing these movements. While the finger-nose test primarily assesses coordination and intention tremor, the dysdiadochokinesia test evaluates a different aspect of cerebellar function - the ability to rapidly alternate movements. Together, these tests provide a more comprehensive assessment of upper limb coordination.

It detects head position, movement, and acceleration, which is essential for maintaining balance and coordinating eye movements with head position. The vestibulocochlear nerve has two distinct components: the vestibular branch, which carries information about balance and spatial orientation, and the cochlear branch, which is responsible for hearing. The vestibular system includes the semicircular canals (detecting rotational acceleration), utricle, and saccule (detecting linear acceleration and gravity).

The accessory nerve has two components: a cranial part that joins with the vagus nerve and a spinal part that innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Damage to this nerve can result in weakness of these muscles, causing difficulty with head rotation, shoulder elevation, and scapular stabilization. Patients may present with shoulder droop, winged scapula, and weakness in turning the head against resistance.

This reflex tests both the afferent pathway (optic nerve) and the efferent pathway (oculomotor nerve). When light is shone into the eye, the oculomotor nerve carries parasympathetic fibers that cause constriction of the pupil via the sphincter pupillae muscle. The oculomotor nerve has several functions including innervation of the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles (responsible for most eye movements), the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (responsible for eyelid elevation), and parasympathetic fibers that constrict the pupil and accommodate the lens.

{"question":"Myasthenia gravis can cause which of the following motor abnormalities?","exp":"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. This fluctuating weakness is due to antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which impairs neuromuscular transmission. The weakness typically affects ocular, facial, bulbar, and limb muscles in a variable pattern. Unlike upper motor neuron lesions (which cause spasticity, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski sign), myasthenia gravis affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to fatigable weakness without changes in muscle tone or reflexes (though reflexes may diminish with prolonged muscle use).

{"question":"The facial nerve innervates which of the following structures to control lacrimation, salivation, and nasal secretion?","exp":"The facial nerve (CN VII) provides parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland (controlling tear production), submandibular gland, and sublingual gland (both controlling salivation). It also innervates the nasal mucosa, controlling nasal secretion. These functions are mediated through the pterygopalatine ganglion (for lacrimation and nasal secretion) and the submandibular ganglion (for salivation). The parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve originate in the superior salivatory nucleus. Those destined for the lacrimal and nasal glands travel via the greater petrosal nerve and synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, while those for the submandibular and sublingual glands travel via the chorda tympani and synapse in the submandibular ganglion.

During this test, the patient is asked to place one heel on the opposite knee and then slide it down the shin. This movement requires smooth coordination and is sensitive to cerebellar dysfunction, which may cause the movement to become jerky or irregular. The heel-to-shin test is the lower limb equivalent of the finger-to-nose test used for upper limb coordination. It assesses the patient's ability to perform coordinated movements and detect dysmetria (inability to control range of movement), which is a hallmark of cerebellar dysfunction.

This sign is caused by irritation of the spinal cord, particularly in the cervical region, and is often associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis, cervical spondylosis, or spinal cord compression. Lhermitte's sign is thought to result from mechanical stimulation of hyperexcitable demyelinated axons in the cervical spinal cord during neck flexion. While it is classically associated with multiple sclerosis (occurring in up to 25% of MS patients), it can also occur in other conditions that affect the cervical spinal cord, including cervical spondylotic myelopathy, radiation myelopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, and trauma.

Patients with apraxic of gait have difficulty with the motor planning of walking, resulting in a gait that appears hesitant, with feet seemingly \"stuck to the floor\" (magnetic gait), and difficulty initiating walking. Apraxic gait is often seen in conditions affecting the frontal lobes, particularly normal pressure hydrocephalus, bilateral frontal lobe lesions, or diffuse cerebral disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Unlike other gait abnormalities (such as cerebellar ataxia, which is wide-based and unsteady, or spastic gait with scissoring), apraxic gait is primarily a disorder of motor planning rather than strength, coordination, or sensation.

During this test, the patient is asked to shrug their shoulders against resistance applied by the examiner. The accessory nerve primarily innervates the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. To fully assess its function, both muscles should be tested. In addition to the shoulder shrug test for the trapezius, the examiner should also test the sternocleidomastoid by asking the patient to turn their head against resistance.

{"question":"A lesion of which cranial nerve could cause ptosis?","exp":"A lesion of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) can cause ptosis, which is drooping of the upper eyelid. This occurs because the oculomotor nerve innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, the primary muscle responsible for elevating the eyelid. Damage to this nerve results in weakness or paralysis of this muscle, leading to ptosis. In addition to ptosis, oculomotor nerve palsy typically presents with other signs including \"down and out\" deviation of the eye (due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles), mydriasis (pupillary dilation), and loss of accommodation.

The patient is then asked where they hear the sound best: in the left ear, right ear, or equally in both ears (midline). This test helps differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. In normal hearing, the sound is perceived equally in both ears or in the midline. In unilateral conductive hearing loss, the sound is perceived as louder in the affected ear because bone conduction is enhanced relative to air conduction. In unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, the sound is perceived as louder in the unaffected ear because the cochlea on the affected side is less sensitive.

{"question":"If a patient reports hearing the sound in both ears during Weber's test, what may be the cause?","exp":"If a patient reports hearing the sound equally in both ears (or in the midline) during Weber's test, it suggests either normal hearing or bilateral symmetric hearing loss (either conductive or sensorineural). This occurs because the sound transmission through bone conduction is equal in both ears, so there is no lateralization of the sound to one side. Weber's test relies on comparing bone conduction between the two ears. When hearing is normal or equally affected in both ears, the sound is perceived equally in both ears or in the middle. This finding is non-specific and doesn't differentiate between normal hearing and symmetric hearing loss.

The patient is instructed to maintain their balance, and their response is observed to determine if they can recover without taking more than one or two steps or falling. The Pull Test is a specific examination technique designed to evaluate postural reflexes and balance. By applying a sudden backward pull on the shoulders, the examiner simulates a balance challenge that would normally trigger automatic postural adjustments.

{"question":"Where does upper motor neuron weakness arise from?","exp":"Upper motor neuron (UMN) weakness arises from damage to neurons in the motor cortex or their axons that travel through the corticospinal tracts to the brainstem and spinal cord. These neurons are called \"upper\" because they originate in the cortex and synapse with \"lower\" motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, which directly innervate muscles. UMN weakness is characterized by specific features including spasticity (increased muscle tone), hyperreflexia, and the presence of pathological reflexes like the Babinski sign. It differs from lower motor neuron weakness, which arises from damage to the anterior horn cells, peripheral nerves, or neuromuscular junction, and is characterized by flaccidity, hyporeflexia, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations.

{"question":"Which branch of the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation of the forehead, upper eyelid, and nose?","exp":"The ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation from the forehead, upper eyelid, and nose. It is the first and most superior branch of the trigeminal nerve and provides sensory innervation to the scalp, forehead, upper eyelid, cornea, conjunctiva, and the side of the nose. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) has three main divisions: the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3). The ophthalmic division (V1) innervates the area above the eyes and including the forehead. The maxillary division (V2) innervates the middle portion of the face, including the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip. The mandibular division (V3) innervates the lower part of the face, including the lower lip, chin, and jaw, and also contains motor fibers that innervate the muscles of mastication.","cop":1,"opa":"Ophthalmic division (V1)","opb":"Maxillary division (V2)","opc":"Mandibular division (V3)","opd":"Motor root of the trigeminal nerve","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_trigeminal_forehead_064","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is the most common site of compression for the median nerve?","exp":"The most common site of compression for the median nerve is at the wrist in the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the narrow carpal tunnel, along with the flexor tendons of the fingers. This condition is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting millions of people. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. The median nerve, along with nine flexor tendons, passes through this confined space. Any condition that reduces the space in the tunnel or increases the contents can lead to compression of the median nerve. Risk factors include repetitive hand use, pregnancy, obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and arthritis. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and pain in the thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger, as well as weakness in thumb abduction and opposition.","cop":2,"opa":"At the elbow","opb":"At the wrist (carpal tunnel)","opc":"At the axilla","opd":"In the forearm","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_median_nerve_compression_065","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which cranial nerve is affected by Bell's Palsy?","exp":"Bell's palsy is a condition that affects the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), causing sudden, temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. This results in an inability to control facial expressions on the affected side, including difficulty with smiling, closing the eye, and making facial expressions. Bell's palsy is considered an idiopathic condition, though it's often associated with viral infections (particularly herpes simplex virus) that cause inflammation and compression of the facial nerve in the facial canal. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression, carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and provides parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibular, and sublingual glands. When affected by Bell's palsy, patients may experience facial weakness, loss of taste on the anterior tongue, hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sounds), and sometimes decreased lacrimation.","cop":2,"opa":"Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal)","opb":"Cranial Nerve VII (Facial)","opc":"Cranial Nerve VIII (Vestibulocochlear)","opd":"Cranial Nerve IX (Glossopharyngeal)","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_bells_palsy_nerve_066","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which cranial nerve is responsible for parasympathetic innervation of the thorax and abdomen, as well as sensory innervation of the pharynx, larynx, and viscera?","exp":"The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is responsible for parasympathetic innervation of the thorax and abdomen, as well as sensory innervation of the pharynx, larynx, and viscera. It is the longest cranial nerve and has the widest distribution in the body, extending beyond the head and neck to innervate organs in the thorax and abdomen. The vagus nerve has multiple functions: it provides parasympathetic innervation to the heart (slowing heart rate), lungs (bronchoconstriction), and digestive tract (increasing motility and secretion). It also carries sensory information from the pharynx, larynx, and viscera, and motor fibers to the muscles of the pharynx and larynx (except the stylopharyngeus). The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the parasympathetic nervous system, often described as the \"rest and digest\" system, which counterbalances the sympathetic \"fight or flight\" response.","cop":3,"opa":"Cranial Nerve VII (Facial)","opb":"Cranial Nerve IX (Glossopharyngeal)","opc":"Cranial Nerve X (Vagus)","opd":"Cranial Nerve XI (Accessory)","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_vagus_functions_067","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What does it mean if a patient is not oriented to time?","exp":"When a patient is not oriented to time, it means they do not know the current date, time of day, day of the week, month, season, or year. This is one component of the mental status examination that assesses a person's awareness of their immediate circumstances and is often affected in conditions like delirium, dementia, or other cognitive impairments. Orientation is typically assessed in three domains: time, place, and person. A person who is not oriented to time may still be oriented to place (knowing they are in a hospital, for example) and person (knowing their own name). Disorientation to time is often the first to occur in cognitive decline, followed by disorientation to place, and finally to person. This pattern is because time orientation requires the most complex cognitive processing, including memory, attention, and executive function.","cop":3,"opa":"The patient does not know their name","opb":"The patient does not know where they are","opc":"The patient does not know the current date, time, or season","opd":"The patient does not recognize familiar people","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_orientation_time_068","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which of the following is NOT a feature of Mask-Like Facies?","exp":"Blinking frequency is NOT typically considered a feature of mask-like facies. Mask-like facies, also known as hypomimia, is characterized by reduced facial expression, a fixed stare, and overall lack of spontaneous facial movements. While patients with Parkinson's disease (who often exhibit mask-like facies) may have decreased blink frequency, this is not considered a defining feature of the mask-like appearance itself. Mask-like facies is primarily characterized by a reduction in facial expressiveness (hypomimia), which gives the face a rigid, mask-like appearance. Other features include a fixed stare with reduced eye blinking, loss of spontaneous facial gestures, and sometimes a slight drooping of the mouth. This condition is most commonly associated with Parkinson's disease but can also occur in other conditions like progressive supranuclear palsy or after long-term use of certain medications.

{"question":"Which of the following is a potential finding on a pupillary light reflex test in a patient with a lesion of the oculomotor nerve?","exp":"A potential finding on a pupillary light reflex test in a patient with a lesion of the oculomotor nerve is a dilated pupil (mydriasis) on the affected side. This occurs because the oculomotor nerve carries parasympathetic fibers that constrict the pupil via the sphincter pupillae muscle. When this nerve is damaged, the unopposed action of the sympathetic nervous system causes pupil dilation. In addition to mydriasis, a complete oculomotor nerve lesion will also cause ptosis (due to weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle) and \"down and out\" deviation of the eye (due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles). The pupillary light reflex will be impaired or absent on the affected side because the efferent pathway (oculomotor nerve) is damaged, though the afferent pathway (optic nerve) remains intact. This is a key distinguishing feature from other causes of pupil abnormalities.","cop":2,"opa":"Sluggish pupillary constriction","opb":"Dilated pupil (mydriasis) on the affected side","opc":"Constricted pupil (miosis) on the affected side","opd":"Anisocoria that is more pronounced in bright light","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_oculomotor_pupil_070","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which of the following tests can be used to assess the function of the hypoglossal nerve?","exp":"Tongue protrusion is a test used to assess the function of the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII). During this test, the patient is asked to protrude their tongue straight forward. The examiner observes for any deviation, atrophy, or fasciculations. If the hypoglossal nerve is damaged, the tongue will typically deviate toward the side of the lesion due to unopposed action of the intact genioglossus muscle on the unaffected side. The hypoglossal nerve is a purely motor nerve that innervates all the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle (which is innervated by the vagus nerve). In addition to observing tongue protrusion, the examiner may also ask the patient to move their tongue from side to side against resistance to further assess its strength. Damage to the hypoglossal nerve can result in dysarthria (difficulty with articulation), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and weakness of the tongue muscles, which may also cause atrophy and fasciculations over time.","cop":1,"opa":"Tongue protrusion","opb":"Shoulder shrug against resistance","opc":"Eye movement assessment","opd":"Facial expression assessment","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_hypoglossal_test_071","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"In a normal Rinne's test result, which of the following is true?","exp":"In a normal Rinne's test result, air conduction (AC) is heard longer than bone conduction (BC), denoted as AC > BC. This is because, under normal circumstances, sound is conducted more efficiently through air than through bone. During the test, a vibrating tuning fork is first placed on the mastoid process (bone conduction), and when the patient can no longer hear it, it's moved near the ear canal (air conduction), where it should still be audible. The Rinne test compares air and bone conduction hearing. In normal hearing and in sensorineural hearing loss, air conduction remains better than bone conduction (AC > BC), though both may be reduced in sensorineural loss. In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is heard longer than air conduction (BC > AC) because the transmission of sound through the outer and middle ear is impaired, but bone conduction (which bypasses these structures) remains intact. This reversal (BC > AC) is considered a negative Rinne test and indicates conductive hearing loss.","cop":1,"opa":"Air conduction is heard longer than bone conduction (AC > BC)","opb":"Bone conduction is heard longer than air conduction (BC > AC)","opc":"Air conduction equals bone conduction (AC = BC)","opd":"No sound is heard through either air or bone conduction","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_rinne_normal_072","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is Peek sign a sign of?","exp":"Peek sign is a clinical indicator of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscles. This sign is observed when a patient with myasthenia gravis attempts to keep their eyes gently closed and the eyelids begin to flutter open spontaneously, revealing the sclera (white part of the eye) between the eyelids. Peek sign occurs due to weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscles, which are responsible for closing the eyelids. In myasthenia gravis, the neuromuscular transmission is impaired due to antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, leading to muscle weakness that worsens with activity. The peek sign is particularly useful for assessing ocular involvement in myasthenia gravis, which is common in this condition.

{"question":"When a patient uses circumlocution, what might they say when they cannot recall a word?","exp":"Circumlocution is a speech pattern where a patient, unable to recall a specific word, describes or defines it using multiple words instead. This is a common compensatory strategy seen in various language disorders, particularly in anomia (word-finding difficulty) which can occur in conditions like aphasia, dementia, or other cognitive impairments. For example, if a patient cannot recall the word \"watch,\" they might say \"the thing you wear on your wrist to tell time.\" This strategy demonstrates that the patient understands the concept and has preserved semantic knowledge but has difficulty accessing the specific lexical representation. Circumlocution is often contrasted with other paraphasias: phonemic paraphasias (using similar-sounding words like \"wath\" for \"watch\"), semantic paraphasias (using related words like \"clock\" for \"watch\"), or neologisms (invented words). The use of circumlocution suggests that the patient has insight into their language difficulty and is attempting to compensate for it.","cop":3,"opa":"They remain silent","opb":"They use a similar-sounding word","opc":"They describe the word or concept with multiple words","opd":"They use a word that is completely unrelated","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_circumlocution_074","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"A 65-year-old male presents with muscle wasting in his right arm that has been progressing slowly over the past few years. On examination, there is atrophy of the interossei muscles, and weakness in finger abduction. Which nerve is most likely to be affected?","exp":"The ulnar nerve is most likely to be affected in this case. The ulnar nerve innervates the interossei muscles (both dorsal and palmar) and is responsible for finger abduction (spreading the fingers). Atrophy of the interossei muscles and weakness in finger abduction are classic signs of ulnar nerve dysfunction, which can occur at various points along its course, most commonly at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome) or wrist (Guyon's canal). The ulnar nerve is particularly vulnerable to compression at the elbow where it passes through the cubital tunnel, a condition known as cubital tunnel syndrome. It can also be compressed at the wrist in Guyon's canal. The clinical presentation described is characteristic of ulnar nerve injury, which affects the intrinsic muscles of the hand innervated by this nerve. In contrast, median nerve compression (carpal tunnel syndrome) typically affects the thenar muscles and causes sensory changes in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, while radial nerve injury primarily affects wrist and finger extension.","cop":2,"opa":"Median nerve","opb":"Ulnar nerve","opc":"Radial nerve","opd":"Axillary nerve","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_ulnar_nerve_case_075","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"How is Phalen's Test performed?","exp":"Phalen's test is performed by having the patient hold their wrist in maximum flexion for 60 seconds. This position increases pressure in the carpal tunnel, potentially reproducing the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as numbness, tingling, or pain in the distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger). A positive Phalen's test is indicated by the reproduction of the patient's symptoms within 60 seconds. The test works by compressing the median nerve within the confined space of the carpal tunnel. Phalen's test is a specific (though not highly sensitive) test for carpal tunnel syndrome and is often used in conjunction with Tinel's sign (tapping over the carpal tunnel) and other clinical assessments.

Hypophonia is different from other speech abnormalities like aphonia (complete inability to produce speech), dysarthria (difficulty articulating speech), or aprosody (monotonous speech without normal variations in pitch and rhythm). In Parkinson's disease, hypophonia is thought to result from rigidity and bradykinesia affecting the laryngeal and respiratory muscles, as well as reduced sensory feedback regarding vocal loudness.

{"question":"An example of a neologism would be:","exp":"A neologism is an example of a paraphasia where a person invents a new word that has no meaning in the language. This is a common feature of fluent (Wernicke's) aphasia, where patients may create completely new words or combine parts of words in ways that don't exist in the language. Neologisms are distinct from other types of paraphasias. Phonemic paraphasias involve using a word that sounds similar to the intended word (e.g., \"television\" for \"telephone\"). Semantic paraphasias involve using a word that is related in meaning to the intended word (e.g., \"table\" for \"chair\"). Circumlocution involves describing a word instead of naming it (e.g., \"the thing you write with\" for \"pen\").

{"question":"What is the Babinski sign?","exp":"The Babinski sign is a pathological reflex characterized by extension (upward movement) of the great toe when the sole of the foot is stroked with a blunt instrument. In adults, the presence of the Babinski sign indicates damage to the corticospinal tract (upper motor neuron lesion). The normal response in adults is flexion (downward movement) of the toes. The Babinski sign is one of the most important signs in neurological examination. It is elicited by stroking the lateral aspect of the sole from the heel to the ball of the foot, then moving medially across the ball. In infants under about 1-2 years of age, an extensor response is normal because the corticospinal tracts are not fully myelinated. After this age, the normal response is plantar flexion of the toes. The presence of the Babinski sign in adults can be seen in conditions like stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, all of which involve upper motor neuron damage.","cop":2,"opa":"Contraction of the hand muscles when the wrist is tapped","opb":"Extension of the great toe when the sole of the foot is stroked","opc":"Inability to maintain balance with eyes closed","opd":"Contraction of the pupil when light is shone in the opposite eye","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_babinski_sign_079","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What neurological condition may cause absence of the Glabellar Tap reflex?","exp":"Parkinson's disease may cause absence of the Glabellar Tap reflex. The Glabellar Tap reflex (or Myerson's sign) is normally characterized by blinking a few times (3-4) when the glabella (the area between the eyebrows) is tapped and then stopping. In Parkinson's disease, this reflex may be absent or reduced, which is considered a frontal lobe release sign. While the persistent glabellar reflex (blinking more than 5 times without stopping) is more commonly associated with Parkinson's disease, the absence of the reflex can also occur in this condition. The absence of the glabellar reflex in Parkinson's disease is thought to be related to bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and hypokinesia (reduced movement) that affect the facial muscles. This finding, along with other signs like masked facies, hypophonia, and reduced eye blinking, contributes to the characteristic \"parkinsonian facies\" seen in this condition.","cop":1,"opa":"Parkinson's disease","opb":"Multiple sclerosis","opc":"Myasthenia gravis","opd":"Bell's palsy","subject_name":"Neurology","topic_name":null,"id":"neuro_glabellar_absence_080","choice_type":"single"}

While burnout can cause various symptoms, emotional exhaustion and cynicism are core components. Unlike temporary stress, burnout develops over time and can lead to serious health problems if not addressed.

{"question":"What is a common misconception about mental illness?","exp":"Research consistently shows that people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. The vast majority of violent acts are committed by people without mental illness, and those with mental illness are more often a danger to themselves than others. This misconception is perpetuated by media portrayals that link mental illness with violence, creating stigma that prevents people from seeking help.

{"question":"How can you support someone with a substance use disorder?","exp":"Supporting someone with a substance use disorder involves balancing compassion with firm boundaries. Clear boundaries protect both you and the person with the addiction, while encouraging treatment connects them with professional help that addresses the physical and psychological aspects of addiction. Enabling behavior (making excuses or covering for them) allows the addiction to continue. Judging them harshly often increases shame and may drive them further into substance use.

{"question":"What is a common treatment for depression?","exp":"Depression is most effectively treated with evidence-based approaches such as psychotherapy (like cognitive-behavioral therapy) and/or antidepressant medications. These treatments address the biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to depression. Ignoring symptoms, using alcohol, or isolating oneself can worsen depression. Psychotherapy helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors, while medications can help regulate brain chemistry.

{"question":"Which of the following is an effective way to manage anxiety?","exp":"Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and mindfulness can help manage anxiety by activating the body's relaxation response. These techniques counteract the physiological symptoms of anxiety and help individuals feel more in control. While avoiding anxiety-provoking situations may provide temporary relief, it can reinforce anxiety in the long run by preventing the development of coping skills.

{"question":"What should you do if someone confides in you about their mental health struggles?","exp":"When someone confides about mental health struggles, listening without judgment creates a safe space for them to express their feelings. This validation can reduce stigma and shame, which are often barriers to seeking help. Offering support shows you care and are willing to help them connect with resources. Sharing information without consent breaches trust and can damage your relationship. Telling someone to just think positively minimizes their experience and suggests their struggles are simply a matter of attitude, which is rarely the case with mental health conditions.","cop":2,"opa":"Share their information with others","opb":"Listen without judgment and offer support","opc":"Tell them to just think positively","opd":"Minimize their problems","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_mental_health_confide_020","choice_type":"single"}

Their role is to assess risk, listen non-judgmentally, give reassurance and information, and encourage appropriate professional help, not to diagnose or treat conditions. Mental Health First Aid is similar to physical first aid in that it provides immediate support until professional help can be accessed.

This allows for emotional expression, processing of the loss, and receiving comfort, which are essential aspects of the grieving process. Suppressing emotions can lead to complicated grief or prolonged grief disorder. Using substances to numb pain only provides temporary relief and can lead to additional problems.

{"question":"How should you respond if someone is showing signs of severe depression?","exp":"Severe depression is a serious medical condition that requires professional treatment. Encouraging the person to seek help from mental health professionals is the most appropriate response, as they can provide evidence-based treatments like psychotherapy and medication. Telling someone to cheer up minimizes their experience and suggests depression is simply a matter of attitude, which is not accurate.

{"question":"What is a sign that someone might be experiencing an anxiety disorder?","exp":"Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive, persistent worry or fear that is difficult to control and interferes with daily activities. This distinguishes normal anxiety from an anxiety disorder, which causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life, but when anxiety becomes constant, overwhelming, and interferes with daily activities, it may indicate an anxiety disorder.

{"question":"What should you do if you suspect a child is experiencing a mental health issue?","exp":"If you suspect a child is experiencing mental health issues, it's important to express your concerns to both the child and their parents in a caring, non-judgmental way. Early intervention is crucial for children's mental health, as untreated issues can affect development, academic performance, and social relationships. Ignoring potential mental health issues can allow problems to worsen over time. Punishing unusual behavior or suggesting the child is seeking attention can increase shame and prevent them from getting needed help.

Learning about mental illnesses, their causes, treatments, and the fact that they are common medical conditions can challenge stereotypes and promote understanding and empathy. Avoiding conversations about mental health perpetuates ignorance and fear. Making fun of people with mental illness or separating yourself from them increases stigma and discrimination.

{"question":"Which of these is a common sign of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?","exp":"Avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, where individuals actively avoid thoughts, feelings, conversations, activities, places, or people that remind them of the traumatic event. This avoidance behavior is an attempt to reduce distress but can significantly impact daily functioning. PTSD involves four main types of symptoms: intrusive memories (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.

{"question":"What is a good way to support someone with OCD?","exp":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that the person feels driven to perform. Understanding that OCD is an anxiety disorder helps provide appropriate support rather than reinforcing compulsions. Encouraging someone to stop their compulsions or making fun of their rituals can increase anxiety and shame. Telling them to relax is ineffective because OCD is not simply a matter of being too tense. The most supportive approach involves understanding the nature of OCD and encouraging evidence-based treatment like exposure and response prevention therapy.","cop":3,"opa":"Encourage them to stop their compulsions","opb":"Make fun of their rituals","opc":"Understand that OCD is an anxiety disorder and encourage treatment","opd":"Tell them to just relax","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_ocd_support_029","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"How should you respond if someone tells you they are feeling hopeless?","exp":"Feelings of hopelessness can be a symptom of depression and may indicate increased suicide risk. Taking these feelings seriously and asking directly about suicidal thoughts shows you're concerned and creates an opportunity for the person to express their feelings and get help if needed. Minimizing their feelings or changing the subject suggests you don't take their distress seriously, which can increase their sense of isolation. Telling them others have it worse can intensify feelings of shame and worthlessness. When someone expresses hopelessness, it's important to assess for suicide risk and connect them with appropriate help.","cop":2,"opa":"Tell them to cheer up","opb":"Take their feelings seriously and ask if they're having thoughts of suicide","opc":"Change the subject immediately","opd":"Tell them others have it worse","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_hopelessness_response_030","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"Which of the following is a sign of bipolar disorder?","exp":"Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). During manic episodes, individuals may feel euphoric, energetic, and unusually irritable. During depressive episodes, they may feel sad, hopeless, and lose interest in activities. Unlike unipolar depression, which involves only depressive episodes, bipolar disorder involves both depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes.

Helping them get to a calm environment and seeking medical help is important to ensure their safety and connect them with appropriate treatment. Arguing with their grandiose ideas can lead to agitation or aggression. Encouraging their high energy may reinforce manic behaviors.

{"question":"Which of these is a positive coping strategy for dealing with stress?","exp":"Regular exercise is a positive coping strategy for stress because it releases endorphins (natural mood lifters), reduces stress hormones like cortisol, and improves overall physical and mental health. Exercise also provides a healthy outlet for tension and can improve sleep quality. Unhealthy coping strategies like using drugs or alcohol may provide temporary relief but often lead to additional problems. Ignoring problems allows them to accumulate and worsen over time.

{"question":"What is a sign that someone might be experiencing social anxiety disorder?","exp":"Social anxiety disorder is characterized by an intense, persistent fear of social situations where one might be scrutinized or negatively evaluated by others. This fear is out of proportion to the actual threat and leads to avoidance of social situations or endurance with intense anxiety. Unlike normal shyness, social anxiety disorder causes significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. People with this condition may fear activities like public speaking, meeting new people, eating in front of others, or using public restrooms.

{"question":"How can you support a colleague who is showing signs of stress?","exp":"Supporting a colleague showing signs of stress involves offering a listening ear in a non-judgmental way and encouraging them to seek appropriate help if needed. This approach shows you care about their wellbeing while respecting their autonomy. Increasing their workload would likely worsen their stress.

In such situations, calling emergency services or a crisis hotline is appropriate to get immediate professional help. Waiting to see if the situation resolves could be dangerous if the person is at risk of harm. Leaving them alone may increase their sense of isolation and risk.

{"question":"How should you support someone experiencing grief?","exp":"Grief is a natural response to loss, and supporting someone who is grieving involves providing a safe space for them to express their feelings without judgment. Validating their emotions by acknowledging that their feelings are normal and understandable can provide comfort and support. Telling someone to move on or minimize their loss dismisses their experience and can make them feel misunderstood or ashamed.

{"question":"When treating a child with a severe bleed, what should you do first?","exp":"The first and most important step in treating a severe bleed is to apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth, bandage, or your hand. This helps control bleeding by allowing clotting factors to accumulate and form a clot at the injury site. While elevating the wound above the heart can help reduce bleeding, it should be done in combination with direct pressure, not instead of it. Tourniquets are reserved for life-threatening bleeding in extremities that cannot be controlled by direct pressure. Cleaning the wound thoroughly should wait until bleeding is controlled, as it can disrupt clot formation.","cop":1,"opa":"Apply direct pressure to the wound","opb":"Elevate the wound above the heart","opc":"Apply a tourniquet immediately","opd":"Clean the wound thoroughly","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_severe_bleed_055","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What should you do if a child has a seizure?","exp":"During a seizure, the priority is to keep the child safe. Placing the child in a recovery position (on their side) after the seizure activity stops helps keep their airway clear and prevents choking if they vomit. Restraint during a seizure can cause injuries such as fractures or dislocations. Putting objects in the mouth can damage teeth, gums, or jaw, and there's no risk of swallowing the tongue. Leaving the child completely alone during a seizure could result in injury if they hit nearby objects.

{"question":"How should you treat a burn on a child's hand?","exp":"The recommended first aid for a burn is to run cool (not cold) water over the affected area for 10-20 minutes. This helps stop the burning process, reduces pain, and minimizes tissue damage by cooling the skin and underlying tissues. Applying ice directly can cause further tissue damage, such as frostbite. Applying butter or ointment can trap heat and increase the risk of infection. Popping blisters removes the body's natural barrier against infection and can slow healing.

{"question":"If a child has swallowed a harmful substance, what should you do?","exp":"If a child has swallowed a harmful substance, the first step should be to call poison control immediately (or emergency services if poison control is not available). Poison control experts can provide specific instructions based on the substance ingested, the amount, and the child's age and weight. Inducing vomiting can be dangerous if the substance is corrosive, petroleum-based, or if the child is at risk of aspirating the vomit.

{"question":"What is the most important thing to do if a child is having an asthma attack?","exp":"During an asthma attack, the most important intervention is to help the child use their quick-relief (rescue) inhaler, which typically contains a short-acting bronchodilator like albuterol. This medication helps relax the muscles around the airways, making breathing easier. Having the child lie down can make breathing more difficult during an asthma attack. Giving water or applying a cold compress doesn't address the airway constriction that occurs during an asthma attack.

{"question":"How should you position a child who is in shock?","exp":"The recommended position for a child in shock is lying flat on their back with their legs elevated about 12 inches. This position, sometimes called the shock position, helps increase blood flow to vital organs by using gravity to return blood from the extremities to the core. Sitting upright or on their side may not provide the same benefit to blood circulation. In a fetal position, the child's airway might be compromised.

{"question":"What is the correct way to open the airway of an unconscious infant?","exp":"For an unconscious infant, especially when there is concern about a possible cervical spine injury, the jaw thrust maneuver without head tilt is the preferred method to open the airway. This technique involves placing your fingers behind the angles of the lower jaw and lifting it forward while stabilizing the head. The head tilt-chin lift maneuver is generally used for older children and adults without suspected spinal injuries.

{"question":"Which symptom indicates a child might be experiencing anaphylaxis?","exp":"Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. Difficulty breathing or swallowing indicates airway involvement, which is a hallmark of anaphylaxis and requires immediate administration of epinephrine and emergency medical care. While mild itching and slight redness can occur with allergic reactions, they are not indicators of anaphylaxis. Low-grade fever is not typically associated with anaphylaxis.

{"question":"How should you treat a nosebleed in a child?","exp":"The correct treatment for a nosebleed is to have the child sit upright, lean forward slightly, and pinch the soft part of the nose (just below the bony bridge) firmly for 10 minutes. This position helps prevent blood from flowing down the throat while the pressure promotes clotting. Tilting the head back can cause blood to flow down the throat, potentially leading to nausea or choking. Applying ice to the back of the neck is not as effective as direct pressure. Blowing the nose forcefully can dislodge any clots that have formed and prolong bleeding. If bleeding persists after 10 minutes of pressure, medical attention should be sought.","cop":2,"opa":"Have the child tilt their head back","opb":"Pinch the soft part of the nose for 10 minutes","opc":"Apply ice to the back of the neck","opd":"Have the child blow their nose forcefully","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_nosebleed_treatment_064","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"When should you seek medical attention for a child with a head injury?","exp":"Medical attention should be sought immediately for a child with a head injury if there is any loss of consciousness, confusion, persistent vomiting, severe headache, changes in behavior, or other concerning symptoms. These could indicate a concussion or more serious brain injury that requires prompt evaluation. Waiting to see if symptoms worsen can delay critical treatment. Even brief loss of consciousness should be taken seriously in children.

{"question":"What is the first step in treating a bee sting in a child?","exp":"The first step in treating a bee sting is to remove the stinger if it's still present in the skin. The stinger continues to release venom for several seconds after the sting, so prompt removal can reduce the amount of venom injected and the severity of the reaction. A cold compress can help reduce pain and swelling after the stinger is removed. A baking soda paste may provide some relief for bee stings but should be applied after stinger removal. Antihistamines can help with allergic reactions but are not the first step in treatment. The stinger should be removed by scraping it off with a fingernail or credit card, not by squeezing with tweezers, which can inject more venom.","cop":2,"opa":"Apply a cold compress","opb":"Remove the stinger if visible","opc":"Apply a baking soda paste","opd":"Give the child an antihistamine","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_bee_sting_066","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"How should you manage a child with suspected heat exhaustion?","exp":"Heat exhaustion occurs when the body overheats, often due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures or physical activity. The first step in management is to move the child to a cooler environment, preferably in shade or air conditioning, and provide fluids to prevent dehydration. A cold bath might be too shocking and could cause shivering, which generates heat. Wrapping in warm blankets would be counterproductive. Exercise would increase body temperature and worsen the condition. After moving to a cool place and providing fluids, the child should rest and be monitored for improvement or worsening symptoms, which could indicate heat stroke, a medical emergency.","cop":2,"opa":"Give the child a cold bath","opb":"Move the child to a cool place and provide fluids","opc":"Wrap the child in warm blankets","opd":"Encourage the child to exercise to cool down","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_heat_exhaustion_067","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What should you do if a child suffers a dog bite?","exp":"The appropriate response to a dog bite involves several steps: cleaning the wound thoroughly with soap and water, applying a clean bandage, and seeking medical attention for evaluation. Medical evaluation is important to determine if antibiotics, tetanus booster, or rabies prophylaxis is needed. Dog bites can introduce bacteria deep into tissues, leading to infection. Cleaning the wound reduces this risk, but medical evaluation is still necessary to assess the wound depth, determine if stitches are needed, and evaluate the risk of infection or rabies transmission, especially if the dog is unknown or not vaccinated.","cop":4,"opa":"Clean the wound with soap and water","opb":"Apply a bandage and monitor for infection","opc":"Seek medical attention for evaluation","opd":"All of the above","subject_name":"First Aid","topic_name":null,"id":"firstaid_dog_bite_068","choice_type":"single"}
{"question":"What is the first thing you should do if a child faints?","exp":"If a child faints (syncope), the first thing to do is lay them flat on their back with their legs elevated about 12 inches. This position helps improve blood flow to the brain by using gravity to return blood from the extremities to the core. Splashing cold water on the face might help if the child is already conscious but won't address the underlying cause of fainting.

{"question":"Which of the following is a symptom of dehydration in children?","exp":"Dehydration in children is characterized by decreased urine output (fewer wet diapers or infrequent urination), dry mouth, sunken eyes, absence of tears when crying, lethargy, and in infants, a sunken fontanelle (soft spot on the head). These symptoms indicate that the body doesn't have enough fluid to function properly. Frequent urination is not a symptom of dehydration; in fact, it's more commonly associated with other conditions like diabetes or urinary tract infections.

{"question":"What is the recommended treatment for a child with a sprained ankle?","exp":"The RICE method is the recommended initial treatment for a sprained ankle. RICE stands for Rest (avoid activities that cause pain), Ice (apply cold packs to reduce swelling and pain), Compression (use an elastic bandage to provide support and reduce swelling), and Elevation (raise the ankle above heart level to reduce swelling). Applying heat immediately can increase swelling and inflammation. Massaging vigorously can cause further injury to the already damaged ligaments.

The Berlin Definition for ARDS includes bilateral opacities on chest imaging (not fully explained by other conditions), onset within one week of a known clinical insult, and impaired oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 mm Hg with PEEP/CPAP ≥ 5 cm H2O). ARDS is associated with decreased pulmonary compliance (not increased), normal or increased pulmonary artery pressure, and low arterial PaO2 with normal or low PaCO2.","cop":4,"opa":"Low arterial PaO2 with normal PaCO2","opb":"Increased pulmonary compliance","opc":"Decreased pulmonary artery pressure","opd":"Chest x-ray showing bilateral infiltrates","subject_name":"Respiratory","topic_name":null,"id":"respiratory_ards_characteristics_080","choice_type":"single"}
